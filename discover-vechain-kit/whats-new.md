# What's new?

### ⚡ Faster Development

* We’ve introduced several optimizations that drastically reduce bundle size and speed up development builds.
* To support modular workflows, we’ve also released standalone packages like [**`@vechain/vechain-contract-types`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vechain/vechain-contract-types) and [**`@vechain/contract-getters`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vechain/contract-getters), which you can use independently.
* More improvements are coming soon.

### 🎨 More Customization

You now have much more control over the **vechain-kit modal**:

* Open specific flows in isolation (e.g., only _Receive_ or _Send_, without exposing the rest of the modal).
* Customize colors and fonts to match your brand.
* Use Bottomsheets instead of Modals on mobile!

Check the [Customization](../customization/theming.md) section for all available options.

### **✨ Redesigned UI**

In version 2, we have completely overhauled the user interface to simplify navigation and enhance user experience. The new design focuses on clarity and usability, placing a stronger emphasis on wallet features to streamline user interactions. This redesign aims to provide an intuitive and efficient workflow, allowing users to access essential functionalities effortlessly.

### 🔑 Quick Wallet Switching

Easily switch between wallets without the need to log out and log back in, enhancing the fluidity of your transactions and interactions.

### 🔄 Built-In Token Swap

Swap tokens directly inside the kit—no need to send users to external websites.

Powered by **BetterSwap** and **VeTrade**, swaps are now:

* Seamless
* Secure
* Efficient

Users can manage assets more conveniently than ever.

### 🆓 Smarter Fee Delegation

No more configuring delegation services manually.

V2 includes:

* **Automatic transaction sponsorship** for social-login users (via Generic Delegator)
* An improved `useSendTransaction()` hook that lets you sponsor specific transactions selectively

Even if you’re not required to cover fees, you might still sponsor some transactions—for example, onboarding new users or showing fee costs to social-login accounts. Head over to the [fee-delegation.md](../social-login/fee-delegation.md "mention") section to learn more about this.

### **🛠️ Easier Installation**

A cleaner, more streamlined setup minimizes the time spent troubleshooting.

### **👋 Goodbye Connex, Hello SDK**

Connex is deprecated.\
V2 now uses the **SDK**, offering more developer capabilities and a more modern foundation.

### **📱 Better VeWorld Mobile Integration**

We now use the new VeWorld endpoints, delivering:

* Smoother logins
* Easier wallet switching

### **📘 Improved Documentation**

Clearer, more complete documentation helps you transition and integrate features with confidence.

### **🚀 A Big Roadmap Ahead**

Coming soon (and exclusive to V2):

* Revamped login flow
* Better cross-app connections
* Transaction history
* NFTs
* DeFi integrations
* And more
