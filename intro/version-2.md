# Version 2

This version of the kit deprecated the use of [connex](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/connex) in favour of the [SDK](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/sdk).&#x20;

It may have some breaking changes based on how you integrated the kit inside your app. Please read more in details what changed from V1 and how to migrate to version 2 in [the following section](../migrations/upgrade-vechain-kit-from-1.x-to-2.x/).
