# Intro

Not only can you open specific flows of the VeChainKit modal in an isolated mode, such as showing only the "receive" or "send" flows without permitting the user to access other parts of the modal, but there are also new customization options available. You can now personalize the modals by setting the colors and fonts to align with your brand, making them visually consistent with your app. Head over to the Customization section to explore all the available options.
