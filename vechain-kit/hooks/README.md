# Hooks

The kit provides hooks for developers to interact with smart contracts like VeBetterDAO, VePassport, veDelegate, and price oracles. These hooks work with react-query, improving query capabilities by caching responses and offering real-time states like `isLoading` and `isError`. This helps developers manage and update user interfaces effectively, ensuring a responsive experience.
